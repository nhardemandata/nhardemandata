## 💼 Projects

### 🐟 Fish Species Analysis (R + Python + SQL + Tableau) 🐡
Exploratory analysis and modeling of fish traits using FishBase data  
- Cleaned & joined multi-source datasets using `rfishbase` in **R**  
- Engineered features and built visualizations with `tidyverse`, `ggplot2` (**R**) and `seaborn`/**matplotlib** (**Python**)  
- Modeled fish weight using OLS and log-transformed regression (R)  
- Used **Python** (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`) for extended analysis and cross-validation  
- Exported cleaned data to CSV and loaded into a relational database (**SQL**)  
- Designed an interactive **Tableau dashboard** to explore species traits
